# IfcGeoRefChecker- Quick Guide

[TOC]

## The -IFCGeoRefChecker- tool (Version: 0.3.1.0)

![GUI after checking an IFC-file](pic/GeoRefChecker_GUI_2_v3.png)

### GeoRefChecker functionality

1. **"Set working directory" section**
-- optional, but recommended via Change... button
-- some export files will be stored there
-- you need permission to write in there

2. **"Check IFC-file(s)..." button**
-- main functionality
-- automatically export of Log- and/or json-file to working directory possible (if Checkboxes are checked)
-- check one or more IFC-files per import regarding LoGeoRef concept (see Documentation)
-- imported and checked models will be displayed in Listbox

3. **"Check overview" section**
-- short results of check against Level of Georeferencing
-- switch between results via selecting models in Listbox above
-- (if checked before) buttons for displaying of Log- and/or JSON-file

4. **"--> GeoRefComparer" button**
-- comparing of georeferencing attribute values of two or more IFC files
-- see [GeoRefComparer](#Comparing georef)

5. **Update GeoRef" section**
-- possibility to update/change the georeferencing of your IFC file
-- first step: update georef attributes manually OR via map (external web app)
-- second step: Export Updates to IFC file
-- see [GeoRefUpdater](#Updating georef)

### Comparing georef

![GeoRefComparer](pic/GeoRefComparer_GUI1.png)

1. **"Reference model" section**
-- choose the IFC file which should be the reference for the comparison
-- normally that is the coordination model (with correct georef data)

2. **"Comparison models" section**
-- select the models which should be compared with the reference model
-- please note: they will be not compared with each other
-- normally that are the models of participating disciplines

3. **"Start Comparison" button**
-- start of comparison
-- internally export of compare log file to working directory
-- quick view on compare file via click on "See compare file" button

### GeoRefUpdate functionality

#### First option: edit "...via manual setup"

![GeoRefUpdater](pic/GeoRefUpdater_GUI1_v3.png)

Possibility to edit manually address, Geolocation (Geographic site coordinates) and Geodetic transformation.
Via "Save and Close" the new attribute values will be stored as json in a user defined directory.
The json file will be needed for further IFC export.

#### Second option: edit "...via browser map"

1. **Calculating building perimeter**
-- for later display at the map the application will internally calculate the building perimeter out of the wall geometry in IFC file
-- because of the wide variety of storing geometry in IFC this is prone to error
-- please contact us if calculation will fail or will be incorrect

2. **Saving of json with building perimeter**
-- the application requests to save the json file with the calculated building perimeter
-- please save the file in the working directory or any other known folder

3. **"Building Locator" will be opened**
-- start of the Building Locator via opening your local setted browser
-- on the left side a map is displayed
-- if not check your Internet connection and/or try another browser

5. **Updating georef via "Building Locator"**
- **Select File:** 
-- import the json file with the calculated building perimeter (WKTRep-attribute in json file)

- **Show Existing Georef Information**
-- display of the georef content in json file

- **Select Map Projection**
-- choose one of the offered projections

- **Position Building**
-- displaying of the WKT-string representing the building perimeter
-- via **Draw Building** display of the building and its project base point in the map
-- the positioning is orientated to the Level50 attributes or if they are not given, ob the LatLon coordinate of Level20
-- user defined positioning via **move** and **rotate** functionality

- **Query Buildng Address**
-- get the address of the choosen location
-- source: [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/)

- **Save Position and Download File**
-- updating of the georef json file
-- Download to working directory or user-defined folder

#### Export changes to IFC

![GeoRefUpdater](pic/GeoRefUpdater_GUI3_v3.png)

1. **Export Updates to IFC via IfcGeoRefChecker**
-- import of updated json file from file system
-- choosing of the required export options (dependent to your BIM-software)
-- possibility to edit manually IFC attributes, see [IFC export for experts](#Extended export)

<a name="Extended export"></a>

#### Extended export to IFC (only for IFC experts recommended)

- Updating georef via Level of Georeferencing concept
- displaying of attribute values of certain levels and their corresponding IFC entities

## Built with

- [xBIM Toolkit](http://docs.xbim.net/) - Main functionality used to read IFC-files
- [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) - Functionality for exporting JSON-files
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - Graphics used to design LoGeoRef-Icons
